# AutoHotKey scripts repository
These are some scripts that I've written while learning AutoHotKey. Some might be useful, some might be utter garbage.

User beware.

#### I give no guarantee that any of them will work. Have fun trying them out though.

## Scripts included

### auto-run.ahk
Simple script that I made to simply hold down the **W** button, since I was tired of holding a key to run in Minecraft.

### hold-mouse.ahk
Similar application, where I was tired of holding left-click button. That way you can just leave your computer overnight and it'll continue holding left-click for you.

### spam-script.ahk
Spams **a** over and over. That's it. It's useless.

### record-mouse-position.ahk
This one is actually useful. With this you can record your mouse position with **F6** and save them to a file using **CTRL+J** button combination.
It's pretty useful when you need to setup some automation and you need a list of specific points and AHK's **WindowSpy** isn't doing it for you.
